# Python for Everybody book - exercises

These are commits of the exercises from the 'Python for Everybody' book by Charles Severance that I have been working though.
I would highly recommend the [Python for Everybody website](https://www.py4e.com/) to find information on the book, videos and
lessons or one of the [online courses on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) for anyone 
interested in learning python.
